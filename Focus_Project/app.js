//Sentiment analysis is perhaps one of the most popular applications of NLP,analyzing sentiments
//The key aspect of sentiment analysis is to analyze a body of text for understanding the opinion expressed by it. 
//Typically, we quantify this sentiment with a positive or negative value, called polarity. 
//The overall sentiment is often inferred as positive, neutral or negative from the sign of the polarity score.

//Usually, sentiment analysis works best on text that has a subjective context than on text with only an objective context. 
//Objective text usually depicts some normal statements or facts without expressing any emotion, feelings, or mood. 
//While subjective text contains text that is usually expressed by a human having typical moods, emotions, and feelings, 

//to understand its reception by the people and what they think of it based on their opinions or, you guessed it, sentiment!

//AFFINN is a premade list of words ofEnglish words that are assigned a score. 
//The words have been manually labeled by Finn Ã…rup Nielsen in 2009-2011. 
//The file is tab-separated -> found and used a converted .tsv into a json data file
